## Character Creation Guide

Welcome to the Daggerheart character creation guide! This document will walk you through the steps to create a Level 1 character, covering everything from choosing your class and heritage to defining your background and abilities.

**The Essentials:** Choose your class and heritage, assign trait scores, fill in vital stats, pick equipment, create your background, define experiences, select abilities, and establish party connections.

## Step-by-Step Character Creation

### 1. Choose a Class & Subclass
Pick one of nine fantasy classes that suits your playstyle. Each class has access to two **Domains** (categories of abilities/spells) and comes with a unique class feature. At level 1, you also choose a **Subclass** (Foundation) that further specializes your character.

*Example: Choose Bard and pick one of its two subclasses, gaining the listed features including a special "Hope feature."*

### 2. Choose Your Heritage
Your **Heritage** has two parts:
- **Ancestry:** Your species/lineage (Human, Dwarf, Elf, Orc, Faerie, etc.)
- **Community:** Where you grew up (Loreborne, Seaborne, Wildborne, etc.)

Each ancestry grants two special features, and each community grants one feature. You can even mix ancestries for advanced character concepts.

### 3. Assign Your Six Traits
Every character has six core traits representing their capabilities:
- **Agility:** Quickness and reflexes
- **Strength:** Physical might
- **Finesse:** Dexterity and precision
- **Instinct:** Perception and survival sense
- **Presence:** Charisma and leadership
- **Knowledge:** Intelligence and learning

**Assign these modifiers: +2, +1, +1, +0, +0, -1**

*Decide which trait gets which value based on your character concept.*

### 4. Fill in Level & Vital Stats
All new characters start at **Level 1**. Record your starting stats:
- **Hit Points (HP)** and **Evasion** (from your class description)
- **Armor Score** and **Damage Thresholds** (determined by equipment)
- **6 Stress slots** (mental strain capacity)
- **2 Hope points** (resource for special moves)

### 5. Choose Starting Equipment
**Weapons:** Pick from basic starting options (e.g., greatsword, sword and shield). Note the damage dice and which trait you use to attack.

**Armor:** Choose starting armor (leather, chain, etc.). Add your level (1) to the Base Damage Thresholds and note the Armor Score.

**Standard Gear:** Every character starts with a torch, 50 feet of rope, basic supplies, some gold, plus one Minor Health or Stamina Potion (your choice).

### 6. Create Your Background
Answer prompts to flesh out your character's story and motivations. Examples include:
- "Who taught you to fight and why did they stay behind?"
- "What personal tragedy set you on this path?"

This step has no mechanical effect—be creative or keep it simple. You can even discover your backstory through play.

### 7. Define Two Experiences
**Experiences** are free-form proficiencies or life experiences that give you a +2 bonus to relevant rolls when you spend Hope. Create two experiences like:
- "Skilled Blacksmith"
- "Streetwise"
- "Natural Leader"
- "Light on My Feet"

**Guidelines:** Avoid being too broad ("Strong," "Lucky") or magical ("Can Turn Invisible"). Focus on realistic skills, backgrounds, or personality traits.

### 8. Select Two Domain Cards
Choose two level-1 abilities from your class's domains. You can take one from each domain or two from the same domain. These are your starting spells/abilities.

*Example: A Rogue with Shadow and Blade domains might take a stealth attack from Blade and a sneaky trick from Shadow.*

### 9. Establish Party Connections
Link your character's story with other players using connection prompts:
- "What lie have you told me that I absolutely believe?"
- "Why did I grab your hand when we first faced danger?"

Aim for at least one connection with each party member. Players can veto suggested connections that don't fit their character.

- **Bonded:** When you mark your last Hit Point, your companion rushes to your side to comfort you. Roll a number of d6s equal to the unmarked Stress slots they have and mark them. If any roll a 6, your companion helps you up. Clear your last Hit Point and return to the scene.

# Communities Reference

## Wildborne
Being part of a wildborne community means you lived deep within the forest.

This results in unique architectural and technological advancements that favor sustainability over short-term, high-yield results.

*Wildborne are often hardy, loyal, nurturing, reclusive, sagacious, and vibrant.*

**Community Feature:**
***Lightfoot:*** Your movement is naturally silent. You have advantage on rolls to move without being heard.

## Highborne
Being part of a highborne community means you're accustomed to a life of elegance, opulence, and prestige within the upper echelons of society. Traditionally, members of a highborne community possess incredible material wealth. While this can take a variety of forms depending on the community—including gold and other minerals, land, or controlling the means of production—this status always comes with power and influence.

*Highborne are often amiable, candid, conniving, enterprising, ostentatious, and unflappable.*

## Ridgeborne
Being part of a ridgeborne community means you've called the rocky peaks and sharp cliffs of the mountainside home. Those who've lived in the mountains often consider themselves hardier than most because they've thrived among the most dangerous terrain many continents have to offer. These groups are adept at adaptation, developing unique technologies and equipment to move both people and products across difficult terrain.

*Ridgeborne are often bold, hardy, indomitable, loyal, reserved, and stubborn.*

**Community Feature:**
