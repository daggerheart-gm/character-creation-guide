        <p>Welcome to the Daggerheart character creation guide! This document will walk you through the steps to create a Level 1 character, covering everything from choosing your class and heritage to defining your background and abilities.</p>
        
        <h2 id="essentials">The Essentials</h2>
        <p>Choose your class and heritage, assign trait scores, fill in vital stats, pick equipment, create your background, define experiences, select abilities, and establish party connections.</p>
        
        <h2 id="step-by-step">Step-by-Step Character Creation</h2>
        
        <h3>1. Choose a Class & Subclass</h3>
        <p>Pick one of nine fantasy classes that suits your playstyle. Each class has access to two <strong>Domains</strong> (categories of abilities/spells) and comes with a unique class feature. At level 1, you also choose a <strong>Subclass</strong> (Foundation) that further specializes your character.</p>
        <p><em>Example: Choose Bard and pick one of its two subclasses, gaining the listed features including a special "Hope feature."</em></p>
        
        <h3>2. Choose Your Heritage</h3>
        <p>Your <strong>Heritage</strong> has two parts:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Ancestry:</strong> Your species/lineage (Human, Dwarf, Elf, Orc, Faerie, etc.)</li>
            <li><strong>Community:</strong> Where you grew up (Loreborne, Seaborne, Wildborne, etc.)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Each ancestry grants two special features, and each community grants one feature. You can even mix ancestries for advanced character concepts.</p>
        
        <h3>3. Assign Your Six Traits</h3>
        <p>Every character has six core traits representing their capabilities:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Agility:</strong> Quickness and reflexes</li>
            <li><strong>Strength:</strong> Physical might</li>
            <li><strong>Finesse:</strong> Dexterity and precision</li>
            <li><strong>Instinct:</strong> Perception and survival sense</li>
            <li><strong>Presence:</strong> Charisma and leadership</li>
            <li><strong>Knowledge:</strong> Intelligence and learning</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Assign these modifiers: +2, +1, +1, +0, +0, -1</strong></p>
        <p><em>Decide which trait gets which value based on your character concept.</em></p>
        
        <h3>4. Fill in Level & Vital Stats</h3>
        <p>All new characters start at <strong>Level 1</strong>. Record your starting stats:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Hit Points (HP)</strong> and <strong>Evasion</strong> (from your class description)</li>
            <li><strong>Armor Score</strong> and <strong>Damage Thresholds</strong> (determined by equipment)</li>
            <li><strong>6 Stress slots</strong> (mental strain capacity)</li>
            <li><strong>2 Hope points</strong> (resource for special moves)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>5. Choose Starting Equipment</h3>
        <p><strong>Weapons:</strong> Pick from basic starting options (e.g., greatsword, sword and shield). Note the damage dice and which trait you use to attack.</p>
        <p><strong>Armor:</strong> Choose starting armor (leather, chain, etc.). Add your level (1) to the Base Damage Thresholds and note the Armor Score.</p>
        <p><strong>Standard Gear:</strong> Every character starts with a torch, 50 feet of rope, basic supplies, some gold, plus one Minor Health or Stamina Potion (your choice).</p>
        
        <h3>6. Create Your Background</h3>
        <p>Answer prompts to flesh out your character's story and motivations. Examples include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>"Who taught you to fight and why did they stay behind?"</li>
            <li>"What personal tragedy set you on this path?"</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This step has no mechanical effect—be creative or keep it simple. You can even discover your backstory through play.</p>
        
        <h3>7. Define Two Experiences</h3>
        <p><strong>Experiences</strong> are free-form proficiencies or life experiences that give you a +2 bonus to relevant rolls when you spend Hope. Create two experiences like:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>"Skilled Blacksmith"</li>
            <li>"Streetwise"</li>
            <li>"Natural Leader"</li>
            <li>"Light on My Feet"</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Guidelines:</strong> Avoid being too broad ("Strong," "Lucky") or magical ("Can Turn Invisible"). Focus on realistic skills, backgrounds, or personality traits.</p>
        
        <h3>8. Select Two Domain Cards</h3>
        <p>Choose two level-1 abilities from your class's domains. You can take one from each domain or two from the same domain. These are your starting spells/abilities.</p>
        <p><em>Example: A Rogue with Shadow and Blade domains might take a stealth attack from Blade and a sneaky trick from Shadow.</em></p>
        
        <h3>9. Establish Party Connections</h3>
        <p>Link your character's story with other players using connection prompts:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>"What lie have you told me that I absolutely believe?"</li>
            <li>"Why did I grab your hand when we first faced danger?"</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Aim for at least one connection with each party member. Players can veto suggested connections that don't fit their character.</p>
